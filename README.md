Usually, to customise the default templates for Restrict Content Pro you need a theme to add the template files to. With this plugin, you don't need a theme. Built especially for [Oxygen](http://oxygenbuilder.com/) where the theme is completely disabled.

Simply add your customised RCP template files for the registration form, profile form, login form etc inside the /rcp/ folder located inside this plugin to override the defaults. Everything will work the same as it would if you were using a theme.

See [offical documentation on customising template files in Restrict Content Pro](https://docs.restrictcontentpro.com/article/1738-template-files) for reference.
