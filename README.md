# Oxygen RCP Template Support #

Allows RCP template customisation without needing a theme. Built especially for [Oxygen](http://oxygenbuilder.com/) where the theme is completely disabled. 

With this plugin, you can add your customised template files for the registration form, profile form, login form etc inside the /rcp/ folder located inside this plugin instead needing to add to a theme. Everything will work the same.

See [documentation on customising Template files in Restrict Content Pro](https://docs.restrictcontentpro.com/article/1738-template-files).
